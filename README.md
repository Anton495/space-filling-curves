# Fractals curves

This module realize poly-fractal curves generating system. It allows to generate n-dimensional curves coordinates and to plot poly-fractal 2D edge-continuous curves and 3D face-continuous curves.

Here are the main characteristics of some curves.

The module has been tested to work on Python 3.7.0. It requires NumPy, Math and Matplotlib.
